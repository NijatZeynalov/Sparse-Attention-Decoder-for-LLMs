# Sparse Attention Decoder for LLMs

## Overview

This project implements an **Sparse Attention Decoder** designed to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs). By using a sparse attention mechanism, the project aims to reduce computational overhead and memory usage while maintaining high-quality output.

## Purpose

- **Efficiency**: Reduces the amount of work needed for processing long sequences of text, allowing models to run faster and use less memory.
- **Performance**: Aims to preserve output quality while being resource-conscious, making it suitable for deployment on smaller devices.
- **Key-Value Caching**: Implements caching for previously computed representations during text generation, improving efficiency and accuracy.
- **Benchmarking**: Provides tools to compare the performance of the sparse attention model against traditional models.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed along with pip. You will also need access to a GPU for optimal performance.


## Usage

### Running Examples

1. **Basic Usage Example**:
   This example demonstrates how to use the sparse attention model with your input text.
   ```sh
   python examples/basic_usage.py
   ```

2. **Benchmark Example**:
   To evaluate the performance of the model, use the benchmark script:
   ```sh
   python examples/benchmark_example.py
   ```

### Input and Output Example

- **Input**:
  You can use a sentence like:
  ```python
  input_text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
  ```

- **Output**:
  The model processes the input and may output modified text or attention scores, for example:
  ```python
  output_text = "The quick brown fox quickly jumped over another lazy dog nearby."
  ```

### Code Snippet for Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple code snippet to help you get started:

```python
from sparse_attention_decoder import AttentionConfig, SparseAttention
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
import torch

# Load a tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

# Tokenize input text
input_text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors="pt")

# Create a configuration for the model
config = AttentionConfig(top_k=32, attention_window=512)

# Initialize the model
model = SparseAttention(config)

# Run the model
with torch.no_grad():
    output = model(input_ids)
    print("Model output:", output)
```
